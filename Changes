     - change 'brkpts' to 'breakpoints' on the advice of Andy Lester The old

       reasonable period of time, whichever is longer.

     - require v0.09 of Test::Tester.  Should fix the blow-up reported in
       cpantesters report #176356.

0.11 2004-12-27
     - Fix $VERSION to be interpreted as a string.
     - make t/baz/foo.t a usable do-nothing test script - it seems that some

       files.  Should fix the problem in cpantesters failure report #170736.
     - re-steal^H^H^H^H^Hborrow all_pod_files() from a newer version of
       Test::Pod in an attempt to make it more robust and fix the problem
       reported in cpantesters failure reports #170633 and #120973.
     - Switch from Test::Builder::Tester to Test::Tester, which has a less
       arcane syntax and isn't as bothered about newline differences.
